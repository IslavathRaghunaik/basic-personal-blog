            <h2>Norwegian Characteristics</h2>
                <p>When it comes to world's events, Norway barely makes a noise. 
                This seemingly quiet, peaceful country really does like to keep to themselves on most things.
                Aside from the beautiful Fjords and mountain hills, the people of Norway do stand out when it comes to living their lives.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>The word <em>Koselig</em> seems to be the main characteristic that define this nation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The closest English translation would be 'comfy', but even then this word doesn't seem to do enough justice.
                It's the type of word that you have to see and experience for yourself to understand the true meaning of it.</p>

                <p>Norwegians puts utmost importance on feeling <em>koselig</em>, being cozy.
                They make sure this atmosphere is always present whenever, wherever. No wonder they always seem stress-free!</p><br>

                <p>It is a feeling and state-of-being as if you are well-rested, no-thougts head empty kind while listening to the rustling sound of a fireplace and sipping on a warm cup of cocoa.
                I love the positivity this word exudes.</p>

                <p>Look at these pictures and hopefully you'll get the sense of just how <em>koselig</em> is supposed to feel like.</p>

            <h2>Norwegian Language</h2>
                <p>Let's talk a little bit about the Norwegian language. One interesting thing about it is that it has 
                a wide variety of dialects, despite being a small country.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Alpabhet</h3>
                    <p>The Norwegian alphabet is unique in that it has three extra letters, i.e. æ ø and å.</p>
                    <p>Watch this YouTube video of two Norwegian men hilariously yet accurately depict how to pronounce
                    those letters through a fun song.</p><br>

                <div class="iframe-video">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f488uJAQgmw" 
                    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Grammar</h3>
                    <p>The Norwegian grammar is eerily similar to English, to a certain extent.
                    The sentence structure is also not that far off. What makes this language distinctive is
                    the fact that it expresses the verb before the subject when paired with adverb.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>For example, the sentence "Yesterday, I went to the school.", would be constructed like so in Norwegian: "Yesterday, went I to the school".</p><br>
                    <p style="font-style:italic;">I går var jeg på skolen.</p>

                <h3>Synes, Tenker, or Tror?</h3>
                    <p>Norwegian has three words that mean “to think”, namely synes, tenker, and tror.
                    However, they are used a bit differently, depending on the way “to think” really means.
                    </p><br>
                
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Å tenke</p>
                    <p>Norwegians use this word if they think of something that includes brain activity. For example, you are being invited to a party, but you already have a plan on that same day. When the one inviting you asks for your confirmation, 
                    you say <span style="font-style: italic;">think about it” or “Jeg skal tenke på det”.</span>
                    A good rule of thumb: if it involves cognitive process, use å tenke.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>More example would be: <span style="font-style: italic;">jeg tenker på kjæresten min. (I am thinking about my boyfriend)</span></p><br>
                    
                    <p>Another possible use of å tenke is to refer to something that has been planned. 
                    For example: <span style="font-style: italic;">“I have planned to go to the store tomorrow.”</span></p><br>
                    
                    <p>Native Norwegians would say, <span style="font-style: italic;">“Jeg har tenkt å gå til butikken.“</span></p>

                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Å tro</p>

                    <p>Most of the time this word is translated as to believe. 
                    You can use å tro when you want to express an opinion about something or an event that you 
                    haven’t experienced by yourself.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Say, you want to buy a Paulo Coelhco’s book The Alchemist since everyone is reading it 
                    and praising it. You might say to your friend something like: 
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">“Jeg vil å kjøpe denne boken. Jeg tror den er god.”</span></p><br>
                    
                    <p>In addition, you use å tro to refer something in the future. For example:
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Tror du at det blir regn?</span></p><br>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Å synes</p>

                    <p>Synes and mene in Norwegian are synonymous. 
                    Both can be said to express opinion that you have first-hand experience in. 
                    Use either of these verbs to express subjective opinion. Examples:</p><br>
                    
                    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Jeg synes at lunsj var god. (I think the lunch was good)</span></p><br>
                    
                    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Jeg synes at han er veldig snill. (I think he is really kind)</span></p>

            <h2>Travel Tips</h2>

            <p>Norway is one of the most expensive countries in the world. So, if you plan
            to go there, you better prepare good! The cost of living can be quite expensive, to the point some of the native Norwegians go to Sweden every weekend to buy groceries.
            </p>

            <h3> What to prepare?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Visa</p>
                    <p>Norway is in the EU, so you can get a Schengen visa, unless you are a EU/EEA citizen.
                    The perks of having a Schengen visa is that you can enter other countries that are in this zone.</p><br>

                    <p>Make sure you apply for a visa at least 4 weeks before travelling and do NOT buy your plane tickets before making sure your visa request is granted.
                    The visa fee is EUR 80. You can check the <a href="https://www.udi.no/en" target="_blank">Norwegian Directorate of Immigration</a> site for full visa requirements.

                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><p>Norwegian currency</p>
                <p>Be sure to prepare some Norwegian currency (NOK) before entering the country to make your transaction easier.
                Currently 1 Euro is worth 10.32 NOK.</p><br>

                <p>This goes without saying but you have to carefully budget your days too. Make sure you
                have enough money while staying over there. This currency has just recently went down in value
                so if you're travelling there in the near future, your cost will probably be cheaper.</p><br>

                <p>Nowadays, this country is becoming more and more cashless so you can definitely use your cards for transaction too.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p>They do speak English!</p>
                <p>Most of the Norwegian citizens speak decent English so you don't have to worry about getting lost.</p><br>
                <p>It will be good to learn basic phrases to get you by. They apprecaite foreigners who learn Norwegians. This country also has the lowest crime rates in the world so don't be afraid of asking strangers for help!</p>
                </li>

                <li><p>Four season country</p>
                <p>Norway has winter, fall, autumn, and summer so be sure to pack accordingly! It's one of
                the coldest countries in the world too so if you go there during the winter, be sure to bring one or two jackets!
                </p><br>

                <p>Even if you travel during the summer, you still need to bring an extra layer of clothes, especially if you plan to go on a hike.</p>
